TeraSpout
=========

**TeraSpout** is an open-source [Spout](http://spout.org) client based off of the [Terasology](http://movingblocks.net) platform. It uses the latest of the Spout platform while adding another renderer on top of the platform.

### The Teraspout Address - Ian Macalinao

Zero-score and six months ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this internet a new platform for voxel-based games, conceived in open source and dedicated to the proposition that all devs are what we care for.

Now we are engaged in a great dilemma, testing whether Minecraft, or Spout, will win the hearts of the developers of the future. We are met in a great race to win this. We have come forth to bring about a new client, a client that works, as an early option for those here who give their word to Spout. It is altogether fitting and proper we should do this.

But in a larger sense, we cannot declare, we cannot finalize, we cannot make official this client. The brave programmers who have worked on the client have consecrated the current Spout Client, far above our poor power to add or detract. It is for us the developers of the platform, rather, to complete this unfinished client by presenting an entirely different alternative, rather than downplay the efforts of those men by removing their works. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task of creating a working client to test on -- that we highly resolve that this project not die in vain and be forgotten as other developers mod for a working platform -- that this platform, under the community as a whole, shall have a new burst of imagination -- and that this project of Spout of the community, by the community, for the community, shall not perish from the interwebs.

Developing
----------

To build TeraSpout, run `mvn` in the directory containing the pom.xml. This will generate the JAR for you.

If the JAR is not generated, any blocking compile issues can be found by searching the project for the string `FIXME teraspout`.
